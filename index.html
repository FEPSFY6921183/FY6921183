      This paper presents a novel adaptive learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogeneous 
      classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achive greater incrementantal improvements in accuracy, compared 
      to using a single type of classification model throught the proccess. The stratergy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
      We futher concider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
      adaptive learning and traditional mechine learning approaches. Our results show that_We conclude that..

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
    
  <p id="Introduction_inText" style="font-family: Verdana; width 1100px; text-alighn: justify;">
      Supersonic travel is defined as flight at a greater speed than approximately 761 mph (reference), this became possible for 
      commercial flight in 1976 (reference) when Concorde was introduced. It was capable of flying from London to New York in under 
      4 hours (ref), although revolutionary environmental, economic and noise pollution where highlighted and caused Concorde to 
      eventually be retired. However, new technologies aim to successfully bring supersonic commercial flights back without the previous 
      issues.  
</p>

      
<h3 id="Historical context">Historical Context</h3>
  <p id="Historical_InText" style="font-family: Verdana; width 1100px; text-alighn: justify;">
      The Concorde was developed by British and French aerospace companies and entered service in 1976. Concorde faced challenges when 
      in service due to high ticket price and many environmental concerns. In 2000 Concordes crash provided a pivotal moment to accelerates 
      Concordes retirement in 2003, where Flight 4590 struck debris on the runway, rupturing a fuel tank causing it to crash into a nearby 
      hotel. All 109 people onboard and 4 on the ground where killed. This highlighted a major design flaw that as well as this tragedy led
      to its retirement.

      Sonic Booms: 

      Supersonic aircrafts generate sonic booms, the air gets compressed behind the plane causing a area of high pressure sound waves radiating 
      in all directions from the back of the plane this is known as a sonic boom.  this has been recorded to cause sounds up to ? Decibels that 
      can harm the human ear (ref) and has been known to shatter windows of houses below (ref). 

      Environmental concerns: 

      Concorde brought to light many concerns of efficiency and emissions. The fuel efficiency of Concorde was bad enough that ot was using more 
      fuel per passenger than a regular plane, this also meant that cost of tickets and the amount of emissions increased. This is bad as the Concorde 
      flew at .... m this meant that the emissions at this altitude where severely damaging the ozone layer contributing to its breaking down. 

      Economic limitations: 

      Due to Concordes engines using 4 times more fuel, and that it could carry only 100 people this caused prices to be great and the( airlines 
      to be loosing money running  it )  

      Regulations: 

      Due to complaints about sonic booms overland flight restrictions where put into place in places like the United States, banning overland 
      supersonic flight. These regulations meant that further investment in this technology was limited.

<h3 id="Boomless Cruise Technology">Boomless Cruise Technology</h3>
      <p id="Boomless_InText" style="font-family: Verdana; width 1100px; text-alighn: justify;">
      Boomless Cruise an American company with new technology that aims to eliminate the disruptive sonic booms. They have achieved this by using 
      Mach Cutoff, atmospheric refraction prevents sonic booms from reaching the ground. They achieve this by flying at specific speeds and attitudes, 
      enabling supersonic travel without communities being disturbed as the shock waves dissipate before reaching the ground. 

      Booms XB-1 demonstrator is a testbase for acoustic and aerodynamic innovations. As well as Booms Symphony engine, that was designed for efficiency, 
      reducing emissions. Innovations like this aim to help overcome Concordes limitations by having speed that was sustainable. 

      Some of the potential benefits of boomless cruise technologies include: 

      Faster travel times, Boomless Cruise could cut transatlantic journeys to under 4 hours and coast to cost American flights could be reduced by 2 hours. 
      As well as reduce the noise impact meaning communities will no longer deal with disruptive sonic booms, addressing one of the major objections to supersonic 
      travel. The symphony engines mean that the Boomless Cruise will have better fuel economy than Concorde, this will allighn with global sustainability goals 
      and make the flights more economically viable, as well as targeting business travellers and premium markets. 
      </p>
  
  <h3 id="Analysis">Analysis</h3>
       <p id="Analysis_InText" style="font-family: Verdana; width 1100px; text-alighn: justify;">
      While Mach cutoff can eliminate sonic booms under certain atmospheric conditions it is not guaranteed at all times. Variations in altitude, weather, and 
      geography can still produce audible disturbances. Due to this authorities will likely demand extensive testing before approving full operations. Although 
      Symphony engines are designed for efficiency, supersonic travel will still consume more fuel than a standard commercial flight. Therefore questions remain 
      about whether the reductions will be enough to meet climate targets. Furthermore, public opinion due to Concordes history of the crash as well as noise may 
      cause stalls in new technologies as well as the governments ability to upgrade to new systems to accommodate to them   
       </p>

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
 <p id="Conclusion_InText" style="font-family: Verdana; width 1100px; text-alighn: justify;">
    Due to noise pollution, environmental harm, its economic issues and the evident safety concerns caused by the 2000 crash, the ban on supersonic flight was 
    necessary as Concorde demonstrated the risks of supersonic flight without addressing safety and sustainability. Whereas boomless cruise represents the future 
    of supersonic flight offering the same faster travel with reduced impact on communities and peoples lives. This means that supersonic travel is possible with 
    this next generation of aircraft if it can deliver on what it is being designed for and can do this with out compromising sustainability and the environmental 
    factors.
