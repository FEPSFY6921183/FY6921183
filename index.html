  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
    
  <p id="Introduction_InText" style="font-family: Verdana; width: 1100px; text-align: justify">
      Supersonic travel is defined as flight at a greater speed than approximately 761 mph (reference), this became possible for 
      commercial flight in 1976 (reference) when Concorde was introduced. It was capable of flying from London to New York in under 
      4 hours (ref), although revolutionary environmental, economic and noise pollution where highlighted and caused Concorde to 
      eventually be retired. However, new technologies aim to successfully bring supersonic commercial flights back without the previous 
      issues.

<h3 id="Historical context">Historical Context</h3>
  <p id="Historical_InText" style="font-family: Verdana; width: 1100px; text-align: justify">
      The Concorde was developed by British and French aerospace companies and entered service in 1976. Concorde faced challenges when 
      in service due to high ticket price and many environmental concerns. In 2000 Concordes crash provided a pivotal moment to accelerates 
      Concordes retirement in 2003, where Flight 4590 struck debris on the runway, rupturing a fuel tank causing it to crash into a nearby 
      hotel. All 109 people onboard and 4 on the ground where killed <a href="#BEA">(BEA, 2002)</a>. This highlighted a major design flaw that as well as this tragedy led
      to its retirement.

       <p id="Reasons_InText" style="font-family: Verdana; width: 1100px; text-align: justify">
      Sonic Booms: 

      Supersonic aircrafts generate sonic booms, the air gets compressed behind the plane causing a area of high pressure sound waves radiating 
      in all directions from the back of the plane this is known as a sonic boom.  this has been recorded to cause sounds up to 105 Decibels that 
      can harm the human ear (ref) and has been known to shatter windows of houses below (ref). 

      Environmental concerns: 

      Concorde brought to light many concerns of efficiency and emissions. The fuel efficiency of Concorde was bad enough that ot was using more 
      fuel per passenger than a regular plane, this also meant that cost of tickets and the amount of emissions increased. This is bad as the Concorde 
      flew at 60,000 ft this meant that the emissions at this altitude where severely damaging the ozone layer <a href="#Ozone">(Eastham et al., 2022)</a> contributing to its breaking down. 

      Economic limitations: 

      Due to Concordes engines using 4 times more fuel, and that it could carry only 100 people this caused prices to be great and the airlines would often 
      run flights at a loss  

      Regulations: 

      Due to complaints about sonic booms overland flight restrictions where put into place in places like the United States, banning overland 
      supersonic flight. These regulations meant that further investment in this technology was limited.

<h3 id="Boomless Cruise Technology">Boomless Cruise Technology</h3>
      <p id="Boomless_InText" style="font-family: Verdana; width: 1100px; text-align: justify">
      Boomless Cruise an American company with new technology that aims to eliminate the disruptive sonic booms. They have achieved this by using 
      Mach Cutoff, wheren atmospheric refraction prevents sonic booms from reaching the ground. They achieve this by flying at specific speeds and attitudes, 
      enabling supersonic travel without communities being disturbed as the shock waves dissipate before reaching the ground. As shown in  <a href="#table 1">Table 1</a>, the 
      Boom technology will travel at a lower speed to achive this Mach Cutoff technology as the sound waver will be less dence so will be more easily refracted.

      Booms XB-1 demonstrator is a testbase for acoustic and aerodynamic innovations. As well as Booms Symphony engine, that was designed for efficiency, 
      reducing emissions. Innovations like this aim to help overcome Concordes limitations by having speed that was sustainable. 

      Some of the potential benefits of boomless cruise technologies include: 

      Faster travel times, Boomless Cruise could cut transatlantic journeys to under 4 hours and coast to cost American flights could be reduced by 2 hours. 
      As well as reduce the noise impact meaning communities will no longer deal with disruptive sonic booms, addressing one of the major objections to supersonic 
      travel. The symphony engines mean that the Boomless Cruise will have better fuel economy than Concorde, this will allign with global sustainability goals 
      better than Concorde and make the flights more economically viable as shown in <a href="#table 1">Table 1</a>, as well as targeting business travellers and premium markets.

      While Mach cutoff can eliminate sonic booms under certain atmospheric conditions it is not guaranteed at all times. Variations in altitude, weather, and 
      geography can still produce audible disturbances. Due to this authorities will likely demand extensive testing before approving full operations. Although 
      Symphony engines are designed for efficiency, supersonic travel will still consume more fuel than a standard commercial flight. Therefore questions remain 
      about whether the reductions will be enough to meet climate targets. Furthermore, public opinion due to Concordes history of the crash as well as noise may 
      cause stalls in new technologies as well as the governments ability to upgrade to new systems to accommodate to them   
       </p>

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
 <p id="Conclusion_InText" style="font-family: Verdana; width: 1100px; text-align: justify">
    Due to noise pollution, environmental harm, its economic issues and the evident safety concerns caused by the 2000 crash, the ban on supersonic flight was 
    necessary as Concorde demonstrated the risks of supersonic flight without addressing safety and sustainability. Whereas boomless cruise represents the future 
    of supersonic flight offering the same faster travel with reduced impact on communities and peoples lives. This means that supersonic travel is possible with 
    this next generation of aircraft if it can deliver on what it is being designed for and can do this with out compromising sustainability and the environmental 
    factors.
